# Social Media Post Distress Alert

This is a basic Python script that analyzes social media posts to detect signs of negative emotions or distress. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify concerning keywords and sentiment, then alerts accordingly.

## Current Functionality
- **Manual Input**: Copy and paste the content of a social media post into the terminal.
- **Distress Detection**: The script checks for negative sentiment and predefined concern keywords (e.g., "stress," "sad," "hopeless") to flag potential distress.
- **Output**: Displays keywords, named entities, sentiment score, and an alert if distress is detected.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Integration**: Connect to social media APIs (e.g., Twitter/X) to analyze posts in real time by running the script on a server.
- **User Feed Improvement**: Adjust content recommendations to avoid amplifying negative emotions, prioritizing positive or neutral content.
- **Escalation Alerts**: Notify the userâ€™s friends or support network if severe distress patterns persist.
